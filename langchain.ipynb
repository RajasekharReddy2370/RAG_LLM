and principles of management of Menieres disease SS Sa Ee ,§ DEFINITION Write short noteessay on Menieres disease,Itis a disorder of the inner ear,characterized by vertigo,sensorineural hearing loss,tinnitus,and aural fullness It is also known as endolymphatic hydrops The endolymphatic system is distended with endolymph The endolymph is normally produced by stria vascularis which fills both the membranous labyrinth and is absorbed through the endolymphatic sac It is one of the most common causes of otogenic vertigo B ETIOLOGY Age Commonly seen after the third decade of life Sex More common among men Allergy The inner ear acts as the shock organ producing excess of endolymph Nearly of patients with Menieres disease are found to have concomitant inhalant andor food allergies Sodium and water retention Excessive retention leads to endolymphatic hydrops Hypothyroidism About of cases of Menieres disease are due to hypothyroidism and are found to benefit from thyroid replacement therapy Hypoadrenalism and hypopituitarism are found to be responsible in about of the cases Syphilis and cochlear otosclerosis can also produce endolymphatic hydrops Autoimmune and viral etiologies have been suggested on the basis of experimental,laboratory,and clinical observations o ef 5d ,te ee ,PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Distension of the endolymphatic system due to increased volume of endolymph is the main pathology The increased volume of endolymph may be due to increased production,impaired absorption,or both However,the exact cause of the disease is not yet identified Impaired absorption by lymphatic sac Impaired absorption by the sac may be responsible for raised endolymph pressure There are experiments that show hydrops when the endolymphatic and its duct is blocked Ischemia of the sac leads to poor absorption and hence increased volume of endolymph and eventually leading to distension of the sac Vasomotor disturbance Sympathetic overactivity due to vasomotor imbalance leads to spasms of the internal auditory artery andits branches This causes deafness and vertigo as this interferes with the functions of the cochlear or vestibular sensory neuroepithelium Also,there is

cardinal symptoms of Menieres disease are episodic vertigo,fluctuating hearing loss,tinnitus,and aural fullness Itis commonly seen in the age group of years of age Males are affected more than females This disease is usually unilateral but becomes bilateral later on Vertigo It is characterized by a feeling of rotation of the patient himself or his surroundings It is sudden in onset and may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting with ataxia and nystagmus In severe cases,it may be accompanied by other symptoms of vagal disturbances such as abdominal cramps,diarrhea,cold sweats,pallors,and bradycardia Tullio phenomenon It is a condition that arises due to the distended saccule lying against the stapes footplate where patients develop vertigo due to loud sounds or noise,This is also seen when there are three functioning windows in the ear,eg,a fenestration of horizontal canal in the presence of mobile stapes Hearing Loss It is a sensorineural type of hearing loss and may precede or accompany vertigo It improves after the attack and is normal during the periods of remission This fluctuating hearing loss is quite characteristic of the disease,The recovery of hearing during remission may not be completed with recurrent attacks,leading to slow and progressive hearing loss which is permanent Tinnitus It is characterized by a lowpitched roaring type and disappears after the attack in the initial stage of the disease,however,it becomes continuous with repeated attacks Aural fullness is Nuctuating in nature and may precede or accompany the attack Patients are often anxious and stressed due to apprehension of the repetition of attacks VARIANTS OF MENIERES DISEASE Cochlear hydrops Vestibular hydrops Drop attacks eee eds Only cochlear signs and Cochlear function is normal

Supplies secretomotor fibers Brings taste sensation from the Brings general sensation from the concha,anterior twothirds of tongue andthe posterosuperior of external canal,and plate the tympanic membrane Supplies all muscles of the Lacrimal,submandibular and Chorda tympani and greater superficial It also brings proprioceptive sensation second branchial arch sublingual glands petrosal nerves are afferent fibers from the facial muscles Course of Facial Nerve The motor nucleus is situated in the pons and receives fibers from the precentral gyrus The upper of the nucleus which innervates the muscles of forehead receives fibers from both the cerebral hemisphere whereas the lower of the nucleus which supplies the lower face received crossed fibers from one hemisphere only The motor fibers originate from the nucleus of VIIth nerve,hook around the nucleus of VIth nerve,and received the sensory root of nerve of Wrisberg Facial nerve leaves the brain at the pontomedullary junction,travels through posterior cranial fossa to enter the internal acoustic meatus,it enters the bony facial canal,and exits through the stylomastoid foramen where it crosses the styloid process and divides into terminal branches Motor nucleus of CrN Intracranial Stylomastoid y foramen nternal auditory canal Extratemporal Intratemporal The course can be divided into three parts Geniculate ganglion Intracranial It is mm in length and extends from the pons to internal acoustic meatus Intratemporal Extends from the internal acoustic meatus to the styloid foramen It is further divided into Meatal segment It lies within the internal acoustic meatus It is about mm in length Labyrinthine segment t extends from the fundus of meatus to the geniculate ganglion and takes a posterior turn and forms a

Variations and Anomalies of Facial Nerve Bony dehiscence Itis the absence of bony cover and is the most common anomaly and occurs most commonly in the tympanic segment Itis prone to injury during surgery and gets easily involved in the middle ear infections The dehiscent nerve may prolapse over the stapes making approach to stapes difficult Hump The nerve may make a hump posteriorly near the horizontal canal making it vulnerable to injury during mastoid surgery Bifumeation and trifurcation The vertical of facial nerve divides into two or three branches,each occupying a separate canal and exiting through individual foramen Bifurcation and enclosing the stapes The nerve divides proximal to an oval windowone passing above and the other below it and then reuniting Between oval and round
